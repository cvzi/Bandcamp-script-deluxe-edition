General information about userscripts and how to use them can be found at [openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO).

If you already have a userscript extension installed, you can **[click to install](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/390404-bandcamp-script-deluxe-edition/code/Bandcamp%20script%20(Deluxe%20Edition).user.js)** this script.

This userscript runs on all websites (`// @include *`) because bandcamp pages can have custom domains ([discussion](../../issues/3)).
