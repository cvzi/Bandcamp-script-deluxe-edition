General information about userscripts and how to use them can be found at [openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO).

If you already have a userscript extension installed, you can **[click to install](https://openuserjs.org/install/cuzi/Bandcamp_script_(Deluxe_Edition).user.js)** this script.

This userscript runs on all websites (`// @include *`) because bandcamp pages can have custom domains e.g. https://shop.stereoscenic.com/music ([discussion](../../issues/3)). If you don't want this feature, you can install the alternative version that only runs on bandcamp.com and campexplorer.io: **[Click to install alternative version](https://github.com/cvzi/Bandcamp-script-deluxe-edition/raw/master/dist/release-bandcamp.com-only.user.js)**.
